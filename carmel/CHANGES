Carmel Version 2.00b: Released on 10-26-2001

Here is a list of the major changes from the original release:

1. Files are restructured to allow compiling parts of the code
separately. In the initial release, a change in any file will result
in requiring the re-compilation of the entire code. This is not the
case with this release where only the changed file and anything that
depends on it are recompiled. This leads to faster compilation and
more code readability.

2. The initial release implements its own list and list iterators data
structures. These have been replaced with their STL equivalents in
this release.

3. Memory leak bug fixed. When using batch mode composition (-b),
temporary results are not deleted and hence the compositions end up
consuming your entire  memory. This bug has been fixed in this
release. The bug is in file finite.cc.

4. Memory leak bug is method "buildSidetracksHeap()" fixed in
file kbest.cc.

5. Other memory clean up fixes, such as deleting arcs of a state from
the tied arcs group, if that state is to be deleted.

6. Added an additional option (-P) which is similar to (-i) except
that instead of constructing a constructor for the input, a permutation 
lattice is constructed.

7. The initial version has a limit on the length of input line of
64K bytes. This version no longer has this restriction, so the limit
is the actual limits of string in the STL library.

 
This release  has been tested extensively, however, this does not mean
it is bug free. If you think you have found a bug, please let us know
preferably with samples and explanation on how to recreate it.

Enjoy!
