	* Makefile: changes ARCH to linux/solaris/cygwin/freebsd, set CC.$ARCH to point to gcc version 3

	* src/weight.h: default output base is now e (and output is -30ln instead of -10log)

	* src/wfstio.cc: lines beginning with # (that aren't part of a quoted symbol) are ignored as comments

	* src/finite.cc: new options:
	-g no longer bounds number of arcs taken between min and min+#states, nor requires normalization.
	-G randomly chooses arcs according to joint normalization and lists them like -k
	-u blocks normalization entirely during e.g. training; can be used with -tuM 1 to give forward-backward counts for arcs
	-j performs joint rather than conditional normalization
	-B, -Z, -D options for output format of weights, -H,-J transducer output options:
	may make reading carmel output more palatable to programs

	* README (installation): 
	(usage):
