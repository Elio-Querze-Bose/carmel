tt: tree transducer (and derivation forests EM training)
carmel: weighted finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths)
shared: generic routines used by both

Make sure the environment variable ARCH is set to something
(cygwin,linux,solaris)

Use GNU make (unfortunately, version 3.81 or greater is required due to some
bugs with earlier versions), and find the binaries in bin/$ARCH

Also requires Boost (http://boost.org) in your standard include directory, or
edit shared/graehl.mk BOOST= if you can't put it there

You'll need to extract
http://boost-sandbox.sourceforge.net/program_options/program_options_postreview.tar.gz
into your boost directory as well (although it will be included in future
versions of Boost.)

cd tt (or cd carmel)
export ARCH=linux (or macosx, or cygwin, or linux, or whatever)
make depend
make all
