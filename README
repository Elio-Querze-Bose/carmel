carmel: finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths)
 (see carmel/README).  To build, cd carmel; make install

tt: tree transducer toolkit (and derivation forests EM training) - not included in carmel distribution

shared: generic routines used by both

Make sure the environment variable ARCH (or BUILDSUB) is set to something
(e.g. cygwin,linux,solaris).

for example:

cd carmel
BUILDSUB=linux INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ARCH_FLAGS="-m32 -march=pentium4" make -j 4 install

or, to build without installing (look in bin/$BUILDSUB for binaries)

BUILDSUB=linux  make -j 4

Requires GNU make (unfortunately, version 3.80 or greater is required due to
some bugs with earlier versions' $(eval)), and a recent C++ compiler (gcc 3.4 is
known good, as is Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1)

Also requires Boost (http://boost.org) in your standard include directory (you
can just use the boost directory in this distribution) - set
BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost if you have located your Boost elsewhere.

cd carmel
ARCH=linux 
export ARCH
make

ARCH can be whatever you like - it's not used for anything except to keep object
files and binaries segregated.  (exception: if you build with ARCH=macosx, no
static binaries will be built, since the platform doesn't seem to support it).

If you're mystified by what's going on in the build, look at shared/graehl.mk
