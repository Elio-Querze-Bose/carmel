tt: tree transducer (and derivation forests EM training)
carmel: weighted finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths)
shared: generic routines used by both

make sure the environment variable ARCH is set to something (cygwin,linux,solaris)
use GNU make in either tt or carmel to build everything
