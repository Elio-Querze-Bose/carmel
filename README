tt: tree transducer (and derivation forests EM training)
carmel: weighted finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths)
shared: generic routines used by both

make sure the environment variable ARCH is set to something (cygwin,linux,solaris)
use GNU make (unfortunately, version 3.80 or greater is required), and find the binaries in bin/$ARCH
