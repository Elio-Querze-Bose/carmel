carmel: finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths).
 EM and gibbs training
 (see carmel/README and carmel/carmel-tutorial).
 To build, cd carmel; make install

forest-em: derivation forests EM and gibbs (dirichlet prior bayesian) training

shared: generic routines used by both

Make sure the environment variable ARCH (or BUILDSUB) is set to something
(e.g. cygwin,linux,solaris).

for example:

cd carmel
BUILDSUB=linux INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ARCH_FLAGS="-m32" make -j 4 install

or, to build without installing (look in bin/$BUILDSUB for binaries)

BUILDSUB=linux  make -j 4

Requires GNU make 3.80 or later, and a recent C++ compiler (gcc 3.4 is
known good, as is Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1)

Also requires Boost (http://boost.org) in your standard include directory (you
can just use the boost directory in this distribution) - set
BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost if you have located your Boost elsewhere.

cd carmel
ARCH=linux
export ARCH
make

ARCH can be whatever you like - it's not used for anything except to keep object
files and binaries segregated.  (exception: if you build with ARCH=macosx, no
static binaries will be built, since the platform doesn't seem to support it).

If you're mystified by what's going on in the build, look at shared/graehl.mk

"make depend" may be necessary.
