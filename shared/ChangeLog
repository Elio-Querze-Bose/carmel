	* io.hpp: moved everything from genio.h except what's used for
	get_from print_on macros

2005-03-21  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* genio.h (FRIEND_INSERTER): const C arg -> const C &arg

2005-03-17  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* funcs.hpp: added maybe_{decrease,increase}_{min,max} and
	accumulate for assoc containers, and ONE_PLUS_EPSILON,
	slightly_{smaller,larger} (also used in SyntaxDecoder)

2005-02-28  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* memmap.hpp: added filename to exceptions

2005-01-27  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* normalize.hpp: add-k-smoothing (denominator) (set directly or in
	constructor)

2004-09-23  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* weight.h: e^-2.68116e+11 -2.68116e+11ln 

	UPDATE: so that nobody has to be confused about what the "ln"
	suffix means, the new default output shall be "e^n" (except in
	case of zero, which is just "0" and not "e^-INF", since "-INF"
	doesn't read/write properly using the standard I/O libraries). I
	suggest everyone only produce such outputs, but be prepared to
	read arbitrary real numbers, as well as those starting with "e^".
