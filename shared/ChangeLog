	* normalize.hpp: add-k-smoothing (denominator) (set directly or in
	constructor)

	* weight.h: e^-2.68116e+11 -2.68116e+11ln 

	UPDATE: so that nobody has to be confused about what the "ln"
	suffix means, the new default output shall be "e^n" (except in
	case of zero, which is just "0" and not "e^-INF", since "-INF"
	doesn't read/write properly using the standard I/O libraries). I
	suggest everyone only produce such outputs, but be prepared to
	read arbitrary real numbers, as well as those starting with "e^".
